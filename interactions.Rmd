# oh geez this is going to be an adventure... 







# as my application is being reviewed, it is probably a good idea to start laying out what the code actually will look like so I can hit the ground running as soon as I get the green light.

# maybe do a dry run with my own twitter network data... just to see if it is doable. 

# concerned that the things I'm seeing online don't exactly align with what my initial project description was... do I need to keep digging, or should I be thinking about reframing my project.

# Introduction

```{r setting up twitter api with rtweet, echo = FALSE}

# whatever name you assigned to your created app
appname <- "your-app-name"

## api key (example below is not a real key)
key <- "yourLongApiKeyHere"

## api secret (example below is not a real key)
secret <- "yourSecretKeyHere"

# create token named "twitter_token"
twitter_token <- create_token(
  app = appname,
  consumer_key = key,
  consumer_secret = secret,
  access_token = access_token,
  access_secret = access_secret)

```


```{r loading twitter data, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}

# setting up twitter authorization 
# need account to be approved before I can do this...

# loading twitter data
  # does norman yee not have a twitter... how to deal with that. that is actually crazy to me...
  # should I be looking at pre/post quarantine tweets... time frame?
